            <p><i>"I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the
                    company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth."</i>
                <br> <br> "I was an EMT for many years before joining the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
                course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best—and
                most grueling—time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working
                as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

                <br> <br> "I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer
                for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself."

            <p> <i> "Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!" <br></i>
                <br> <br> "Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                professionals who could help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                student of theirs who only saw wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did
                not disappoint. They were very hands-on, and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
                could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development
                experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
                100% recommend!"

                </i> <br> <br> "The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The
                program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a
                capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need
                from an incredible community of smart and amazing people."</p>
